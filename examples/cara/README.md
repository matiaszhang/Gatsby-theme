## üìù Using and modifying this starter

**Important Note:** Please read the guide [Shadowing in Gatsby Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/shadowing/) to understand how to customize the underlying theme!

### Changing content

The content of this project is defined in four `.mdx` files inside the theme's `sections` folder. You can override the files `intro.mdx`, `projects.mdx`, `about.mdx` and `contact.mdx`. This starter has overridden all files for you already.

You have to use the `<ProjectCard />` component inside `projects.mdx` to display the cards. Example:

```md
## Projects

<ProjectCard title="Freiheit" link="https://www.behance.net/gallery/58937147/Freiheit" bg="linear-gradient(to right, #D4145A 0%, #FBB03B 100%)">
This project is my entry to Adobe's #ChallengeYourPerspective contest.
</ProjectCard>
```

### Change your `static` folder

The `static` folder contains the icons, social media images and `robots.txt`. Don't forget to change these files, too! You can use [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to generate the image files inside `static`.

### Themes

To learn more about Gatsby themes specifically, I recommend checking out the [theme docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/themes/).

### General

- **For most developers, I recommend starting with the [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to Gatsby's documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/).** In particular, check out the _How-to Guides_ and _Reference_ items in the primary navigation.
